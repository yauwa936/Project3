## Design logic

A funding platform where project teams can create funding page, set fund raising
goals and benchmarks. Eventually, project team can collect raised fund after
proving they have delivered public goods.

## Stakeholders

- **Project owner**
  - ethereum wallet address (address)
  - decide how many tokens to issue (uint)
  - project roadmap
  - deliver items
- **Investor**
  - buy/sell tokens
  - lock-in period
  - voting right
- **Merchant (e.g Uniswap, Sushiswap)**
  - deccentralised exchange
- **Funding manager**
  - control when to unlock tokens
  - control payout
- **Verifier**
  - verify the public goods delivered
